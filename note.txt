In the context of Atodev Labs, "Decentralized" means that the power to make decisions is shared by the robots themselves 
rather than being controlled by one single "master computer" or a central server.

Think of it as the difference between a top-down system and a peer-to-peer system:

1. Centralized (The "Old" Way)
How it works: All robots send their data to one central server. 
That server looks at all the requests and tells Robot A to park and Robot B to wait.

The Problem: If that one server crashes, or the Wi-Fi goes down at the main office, 
every single robot in the city stops moving. It’s a "Single Point of Failure."

2. Decentralized (The Atodev Way)
How it works: Each robot is its own boss. 
They communicate directly with each other (V2V) and the resource (the parking spot).

Trustless Negotiation: Because we use a Decentralized Ledger (XRP), 
the robots don't need to "know" or "trust" each other. The smart contract on the blockchain acts as a neutral referee that nobody can cheat.

Resilience: If one robot breaks, or a server goes down, 
the rest of the fleet keeps bidding and moving. The system has no "head" to cut off.
