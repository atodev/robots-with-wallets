    "# Decentralized Resource Allocation for Autonomous Agents: An XRP-Based Micro-Auction Approach\n",

    "**1. Problem Statement:The Contention Paradox**\n",
    "\n",
    "When two autonomous agents (e.g., Tesla Bots) require a non-sharable resource (a single parking spot), a conflict arises. Traditional \"first-come-first-served\" models fail to account for urgency or opportunity cost. If Robot A has 1% battery and Robot B has 90%, Robot A has a higher objective need, yet a queue system might grant the spot to Robot B."

    "To determine the optimal bid, we define the Utility Function $U$ for a robot $i$:$$U_i(t, e) = \\alpha(E_{max} - E_i) + \\beta(T_{deadline} - T_{now})$$Where:$E_i$: Current energy level.$T_{deadline}$: Time the robot must be at its next task.$\\alpha, \\beta$: Weighting coefficients determined by the fleet owner.The bidding process follows a Second-Price Sealed-Bid (Vickrey) logic. This ensures that the dominant strategy for every robot is to bid its true valuation. The winner $w$ pays:$$P = \\max_{j \\neq w} \\{Bid_j\\} + \\epsilon$$Where $\\epsilon$ is the smallest divisible unit of XRP (one drop, or $0.000001$ XRP)."
