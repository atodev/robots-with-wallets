    "To implement a high-efficiency bidding system, we must leverage the specific architecture of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Because XRP settles in 3–5 seconds and costs less than $0.0004 per transaction (as of 2025/2026), it is the premier choice for \"Internet of Value\" tasks involving machine-to-machine (M2M) interaction.\n",
